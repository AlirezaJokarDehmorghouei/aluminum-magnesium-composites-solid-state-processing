## 📌 Research Overview

This study investigates advanced methods for enhancing the mechanical performance of aluminum alloys through composite design and severe plastic deformation processes.

The research is divided into **two main parts**:

---

## 🔹 Part I: Al 5052 / AZ31B Multilayer Composite Sheets

Multilayer aluminum–magnesium composite sheets were fabricated using **Cold Roll Bonding (CRB)** at room temperature with **70% thickness reduction**.

### Key Investigations:
- Formability evaluation using **Forming Limit Diagrams (FLDs)** obtained from **Nakazima tests**
- Mechanical performance comparison with monolithic aluminum
- Microhardness and tensile testing

### Main Findings:
- Significant strength enhancement due to:
  - Severe plastic deformation  
  - Increased dislocation density  
- Improved formability behavior compared to conventional aluminum sheets
- SEM fracture analysis confirmed:
  - Strong interfacial bonding  
  - No delamination between layers

## 🔹 Part II: Surface Reinforcement of 7075-T6 Aluminum

Surface composites were produced via **Friction Stir Processing (FSP)** using **pumice micro- and nanoparticles** as reinforcement.

### Observed Improvements:
- Grain refinement in processed zones
- Increased hardness
- Enhanced wear resistance

Nano-sized reinforcements demonstrated the **highest strengthening efficiency**.
